/**
 * A Cable represents a Physics Constraint which joins two Actors with a rope-like visual representation between them
 *
 * nanos world Cables are composed primarily of two Unreal Engine components: a Cable and a <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/physics-constraint-component-user-guide-in-unreal-engine/">PhysicsConstraint</a>.
 * The first is used for visual purposes only and the second one gives the effective physical effects that are applied to each end of the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Plugins/CableComponent/UCableComponent/">Cable</a>.
 *
 * <i>Info:</i> Cable visuals can be tweaked with {@link SetForces}, {@link SetCableSettings} and {@link SetRenderingSettings} methods. Those methods donâ€™t have effect on the physics being applied and only have effects on the visual representation.
 * Cable physics can be tweaked with {@link SetAngularLimits} and {@link SetLinearLimits}.
 *
 * After attaching the two sides of your cable, the physics can be tweaked to affect how the constraint will affect the objects.
 *
 * <i>Tip:</i> Cables are automatically destroyed when one of the sides are detached
 *
 * <i>Tip:</i> You can find more useful information regarding physical properties of the joint in the end of this page.
 *
 * @remarks <i>Authority</i>: This can be spawned only on the <b><u>Server</u></b>.
